# NEWSPAGE

This project is part of my thesis "A Comparative Study of Standard UI/UX Design and Accessibility-Focused Approaches: User Experience and Usability Analysis."
The goal is to replicate a newspaper website and then copy it to implement accessibility guidelines based on the European Accessibility Act.

> [!CAUTION]
> This is the website that doesn't follow the guidelines. These defects are intentional.
